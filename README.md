Welcome to the Binary Puzzle Garden, which aims to provide solvers and in
the future possibly other programs for the “Binary Puzzle” from:

License is the MIT/Expat Licence. There's not much here yet - see the `ruby`
directory for the first prototype.

Thanks to Meir Maor for giving a talk about Scala on
[August Penguin 2012](http://august.penguin.org.il/) which inspired me to
start working on this, first in Scala (which turned out to be a dead end, due
to the fact it didn't build properly with JDK 1.7.x, which is what I had)
and afterwards in Ruby.
